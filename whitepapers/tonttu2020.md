# The changing world needs new and agile methods to improve cyber security – it is easy to boost information security in companies!

It is important that companies identify the material that they need to protect
to enable efficient protection. Complex isolated networks are not always as well
isolated as you would think. The feasibility study (Toteutettavuustutkimus)
conducted by the National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) successfully
tested and developed new, agile and scalable methods for improving these areas.

Key findings:

 * The cybersecurity of services critical to society can be improved with
   scalable methods that can be deployed lightly. The companies thought that the
   pilot methods gave them immediate benefits.

 * Companies should also invest in monitoring the functionality of production
   networks’ important information security controls, such as network isolation.
   The need is illustrated by the finding made in the project, in which 81% of
   the participant organisations’ networks that were intended to be isolated
   leaked in unexpected ways.
