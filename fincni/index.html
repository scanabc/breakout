                Energy sector is critical, needs to be protected and security can't be outsourced. We would love to
                share our experience from infrastructure protection in Finland and hear your feedback on pain points and
                needs in your specific context.

                We are three companies from Oulu, so it was easy to share our experiences and to decide on a campaign to
                cover pain points we have encountered.

                        <p>Networks controlling critical processes are often isolated and have static assets and
                            processes. But how does one know that the isolation is leakproof and there are no rogue
                            assets? SensorFu's Beacon tests the vulnerabilities in network isolation on continuous basis
                            and alerts if the isolation fails. SensorFleet's sensor platform keeps track of assets in
                            network and alerts if new actors are discovered.</p>

                        <p>Attacks against soft targets work, as criminals leverage third-party data breaches, employee
                            account takeovers and personal devices in the first phase of the attack. Badrap's service
                            turns your employees into your first layers of defence, stopping attacks where they happen.
                            SensorFleet's sensor platform is your second layer. It provides a cost-effective way to
                            detect and investigate compromises at your office locations.</p>
