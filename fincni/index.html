                        <p>Networks controlling critical processes are often isolated and have static assets and
                            processes. But how does one know that the isolation is leakproof and there are no rogue
                            assets? SensorFu's Beacon tests the vulnerabilities in network isolation on continuous basis
                            and alerts if the isolation fails. SensorFleet's sensor platform keeps track of assets in
                            network and alerts if new actors are discovered.</p>
